# üìë AI Invoice Extractor

**Parse Google Workspace & Google Cloud invoices into structured data with ease.**

This open-source tool automatically extracts details from **Google PDF invoices** and exports them to **CSV** for easy bookkeeping and accounting.

The repository demonstrates two complementary approaches:

- `ai_invoice_extract.py` ‚Äì parses invoices with OpenAI‚Äôs `gpt-4o-mini` using a strict JSON schema.
- `parse_invoices.py` ‚Äì a ~10√ó faster option powered purely by regular expressions. It avoids generic AI and extra dependencies, showing that similar tasks can often be solved with straightforward rules.

## ‚ú® Features
- üîç Extracts key fields:
  - Invoice number  
  - Billing ID  
  - Domain name  
  - Invoice period (start & end dates)  
  - Subtotal, VAT, Total (EUR)  
  - Supplier & VAT number  
- üìÇ Batch processing of multiple PDFs at once (`invoices/*.pdf`)  
- üßπ Smart text normalization (fixes dotted/fragmented text in PDFs)
- ü§ñ AI parsing with **OpenAI gpt-4o-mini** (cheap & accurate) using **strict JSON schema**
- üìä Clean CSV export ready for bookkeeping software

## ‚ö° Regex-based Alternative

For predictable invoice layouts, `parse_invoices.py` processes files roughly **10√ó faster**. It relies solely on `pdfplumber` and regular expressions‚Äîno generic AI models or heavy dependencies. This highlights that many extraction tasks can be handled with classic techniques.

You can also explore ML-driven options such as [spaCy's Matcher](https://www.webdeveloper.today/2023/05/list-of-car-makes-brands-and-you-want.html) for rule-based pattern matching on raw text.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OnlineSolutionsGroupBV/parse_invoices.git
cd parse_invoices

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env       # add your OpenAI API key as OPENAI_API_KEY_PARSER
python ai_invoice_extract.py -i "invoices/*.pdf" -o output/invoices.csv

```

Ensure your OpenAI API key is available via the `OPENAI_API_KEY_PARSER` environment variable (the script also falls back to `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

I also wrote a detailed blog post about this project on [WebDeveloper.today](https://www.webdeveloper.today/2025/08/automating-invoice-parsing-with-ai.html). It covers the concept, the challenges of parsing real-world invoices, and how this tool brings together PDF text normalization, AI-powered parsing (via a cost-efficient OpenAI model), and CSV output into a streamlined bookkeeping workflow.

## üîÑ Business Process Automation

This project is part of a broader effort to simplify and automate repetitive business processes.  
By combining PDF parsing, AI-assisted data extraction, and clean data export, manual bookkeeping tasks are transformed into automated workflows.  
The same principles can be extended to other domains such as HR, procurement, and CRM ‚Äî freeing teams from low-value admin work and letting them focus on growth and innovation.
